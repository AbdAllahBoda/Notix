## Wanna contribute to my little project?
Please take a look at the issues and resolve one.

Issues are not necessarily bugs. they could be features. (Pun is not intended, but I'll pretend like it is)

### Setting up the development environment
* Just download and install [Qt5](https://www.qt.io/) (version >= 5.9).
* Open the project in Qtcreator.
* Run the project.
